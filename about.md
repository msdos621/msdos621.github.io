This is my portfolio / blog / space on the internet.  I am a software architect that specializes in large distributed web apps in ruby and .net.  I work for careerbuilder.com and I am currentlly working on moving our main site into the public cloud.  I have a passion for music, coding, staying active and art.

For more than a year, I've been focused on getting healthier and developing good habits, so I've been taking a lot of fitness classes, including karate, kettlebell, TRX. I never turn down an opportunity to do some other exercise, for example Aerial Dance, Soccer, etc.  In the last year alone I have lost ~100lbs so I am pretty serious about it.  You can follow my progress on [fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com/profile/usbsnowcrash/) if you are interested.
